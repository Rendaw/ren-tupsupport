## Setup
To use in a project, 
1. Copy `Tuprules.template.lua` to `Tuprules.lua` at the root of your project.  
2. Copy `tup.template.config` to the root of your project.  
3. Modify `tup.template.config` your liking.
4. Copy your `tup.template.config` to `tup.config`.  

The copies of `Tuprules.lua` and `tup.template.config` should be included in your version control system.

## Writing Tupfile.lua's
Look at `support.inc.tup.lua` for documentation for the methods tupsupport provides.
